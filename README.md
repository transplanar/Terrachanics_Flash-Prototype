#Differences from Final Version

This is the Flash prototype I created for Terrachanics. It retains most of the same functionality present in the finished game, with a few alterations:

* To create links, players must click a building, select the desired output icon, then click the destination building. In the final version, this was streamlined to require only a click-drag from one building to another, with icon matching handled automatically.

* Units move in a direct path toward their target building. In the final version, they move across link paths at a rate of one building per turn, following the shortest path to their destination.

* Players may open an Event menu to view all upcoming Events and how many turns until they Resolve, which includes optional objectives satisfied by the Researcher bringing a technology to that space. The Event menu was removed, and the Researcher unit was reworked into the Agent.
